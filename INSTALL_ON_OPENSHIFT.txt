Notes for installing the application on openshift
=================================================

Prerequisites:

 - a smtp server for sending emails: we have tested with mailgun over smtps
 - google maps api key (public and private)
 - stripes key (public and private)

This application need java 8 and use pgsql for the persistence layer.

We will do a binary deploy using scp/sftp for moving the .war to our gear.

1. Create an new application (scalable or not) with "WildFly Application Server 8.1.0.Final" and attach PostgreSQL 9.2 

2. Follow the section "Deploying your WAR and EAR files using SCP/SFTP" from https://help.openshift.com/hc/en-us/articles/202399740-How-to-deploy-pre-compiled-java-applications-WAR-and-EAR-files-onto-your-OpenShift-gear-using-the-java-cartridges
	- follow point 2,3,4 (clone the repo, remove src and pom.xml, commit and push)
	
3. Then build the application and push the war file (named ROOT.war) to your gear (we are doing a 2 step upload/move as sometimes wildfly detect the war in the middle of the upload).

> mvn clean install
> scp target/alfio.war [YOUR_SSH_USERNAME]@[YOUR_APP_NAME]-[YOUR_DOMAIN].rhcloud.com:wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT
> ssh [YOUR_SSH_USERNAME]@[YOUR_APP_NAME]-[YOUR_DOMAIN].rhcloud.com "mv wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war"

4. Go to the log to get the admin username using

> ssh [YOUR_SSH_USERNAME]@[YOUR_APP_NAME]-[YOUR_DOMAIN].rhcloud.com
> less wildfly/logs/server.log

and search for "admin credentials:"

This will be your admin credentials for the admin section.

You will need to configure smtp/stripe/google maps api key in the admin, section "Configuration"


For updating the application, you only need to upload the war and rename it:
> mvn clean install
> scp target/alfio.war [YOUR_SSH_USERNAME]@[YOUR_APP_NAME]-[YOUR_DOMAIN].rhcloud.com:wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT
> ssh [YOUR_SSH_USERNAME]@[YOUR_APP_NAME]-[YOUR_DOMAIN] "mv wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war"

Reminder
========
1. if you are using the scalable gears, you should enable the basic auth for haproxy

Additional notes:
=================

Connecting to your pgsql database:


>rhc port-forward -n YOUR_DOMAIN -a YOUR_APPLICATION

You will have a similar output:

    Service    Local                OpenShift
    ---------- --------------- ---- -------------------------------------------------
    haproxy    127.0.0.1:8080   =>  [...snip...]
    haproxy    127.0.0.1:8081   =>  [...snip...]
    java       127.0.0.1:3528   =>  [...snip...]
    java       127.0.0.1:8082   =>  [...snip...]
    java       127.0.0.1:9990   =>  [...snip...]
    postgresql 127.0.0.1:36496  =>  [...snip...]

    
The credentials for the database are visible when you execute:

>rhc show -n YOUR_DOMAIN


Use pgadmin to connect using the local address, in our case: 

 - host: 127.0.0.1
 - port: 36496
